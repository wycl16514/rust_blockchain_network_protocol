In last section, we know how to construct candidate peer ips. In this section, we see how to check whether the given ip is running an ApiServer instance by sending a http get request to the "/ping" endpoint, if we can get a "pong" response
message, then the given candidate ip is running an ApiServer instance then we know the ip is our neighbor. Let's see how to use code to implement it.

We need to use the reqwest crate to send http get request then we need to add the dependency at cargo.toml as following:

``rs
[dependencies]
...
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
```

Then we go to mod.rs of apiserver to change the code as following:

```rs
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct PingResponse {
    pong: String,
}

...
pub struct ApiServer {
    port: u16,
    /*
    clone the api server, we will only increase the reference count of Arc,
    and the mutex will remain only one
    */
    cache: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, BlockChain>>>,

    candidates: Arc<Mutex<Vec<String>>>,

    neighbors: Arc<Mutex<Vec<String>>>,
}
```
In above code, we define a new struct which is the message return by endpoing "/ping" if the an ApiServer instance is running on given ip and port. And we add a new vector of candidates, this vector will going to save all candidate peer ip,
and if the given ip is running ApiServer instance, we will add that ip into neighbors. Let's see how to add a handler for endpoing ping:

```rs
 pub async fn handle_ping() -> HttpResponse {
        info!("receiving ping request....");
        let response = PingResponse {
            pong: "pong".to_string(),
        };
        HttpResponse::Ok().json(response)
    }

pub fn sync_neighbors(&self) {
        info!("run sync neighbors....");
        self.get_neighbors();
        let api_clone = self.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || loop {
            info!("timer thred looping...");
            api_clone.register_neighbors();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(Self::NEIGHBOR_IP_SYNC_TIME));
        });
    }

    pub fn register_neighbors(&self) {
        let candidates = self.candidates.lock().unwrap();
        let mut neighbors = self.neighbors.lock().unwrap();
        let candidates_vec = candidates.clone();

        for candidate in &candidates_vec {
            let contains = neighbors.iter().any(|s| s == candidate);
            if contains {
                info!(
                    "candidate: {} already synced by server with port: {}",
                    candidate, self.port
                );
                continue;
            }

            info!("ping candidate: {}", candidate);
            let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
            runtime.block_on(self.ping_neighbor(candidate, &mut neighbors));
        }
    }

    pub async fn ping_neighbor(
        &self,
        candidate: &String,
        neighbors: &mut Vec<String>,
    ) -> Result<(), reqwest::Error> {
        let url = format!("http://{}/ping", candidate);
        let client = reqwest::Client::builder().no_proxy().build()?;
        let response = client.get(url.clone()).send().await?;
        if response.status().is_success() {
            let json: PingResponse = response.json().await.expect("fail to get pong back");
            if json.pong == "pong" {
                info!(
                    "current server with port:{}, ping neighbor with url:{} success",
                    self.port, url
                );
                neighbors.push(candidate.clone());
            }
        }

        Ok(())
    }

pub async fn run(&self) {
    let api = Arc::new(self.clone());
    api.sync_neighbors();
    ...
    let server = HttpServer::new(move || {
          App::new()
           .app_data(web::Data::new(api.clone()))
           .wrap(actix_web::middleware::Logger::default())
           ...
            .route("/ping", web::get().to(Self::handle_ping))
    });
    ...
}
```
In above code the sync_neighbors is create a thread to call methods for finding peers. In the thread it created just act like a timer which calling register_neighbors periodically for every 20 secs. In register_neighbors it get each candidate
ip out from the candidate vector and first check whether the given ip is already in the neighbors vector, if it is, then the given ip is a peer already discovered. Otherwise it will send a http get request to the endpoint of "/ping" on the
given candidate ip, if it can get response with a string of content "pong", then it knows the given ip is a peer and add that ip into neighbors vector.

Now change code in main.rs back as following:

```rs
pub mod apiserver;
use crate::apiserver::ApiServer;
pub mod blockchain;
pub mod wallet;
use actix_web::middleware::Logger;
use std::thread;

/*
127.0.0.1:5000

127.0.0.1:5000 -> 127.0.0.2:5003

127.0.0.1:5000
127.0.0.1:5001
127.0.0.1:5002
127.0.0.1:5003

127.0.0.2:5000
127.0.0.2:5001
127.0.0.2:5002
127.0.0.2:5003

*/

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();

    let ports = vec![5000, 5001, 5002];
    let mut handles = vec![];
    for port in ports {
        let server = ApiServer::new(port);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
            runtime.block_on(server.run());
        });

        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}


```

And run the code after changes. You will get info output like following:

```rs
2024-12-06T15:04:03Z INFO  blockchain::apiserver] current server with port:5002, ping neighbor with url:http://127.0.0.1:5001/ping success
```
The above output shows the server running on port 5002 has discovered the its peer which is running on port 5001.
